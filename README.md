# docapp

A new Flutter application.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

The system aims to mitigate the use of paperwork for the prescriptions and store the details of the patients in large 
facilities piling up the paperwork. The system provides a virtual assistant providing an interface for the doctor to 
interact with the system and dictate the prescription. The system then generates a prescription based on the data provided by the doctor.
The digitally generated prescription is then displayed to the doctor for any corrections. If the doctor wants to edit the prescription,
he/she can do so by selecting the ‘Edit’ button provided. Then the doctor should submit the corrected prescription which is encrypted 
using the AES algorithm and stored in the database.
